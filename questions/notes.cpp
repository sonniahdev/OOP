/*
rules of contructor:
1. they donot have a retun type
2. they must have same name as their class
3. they are public



access modifiers we have :
1. private - means the data is accessible inside the class and outside the class

2. public - means the data in a class is only accessible in the class it has been declared in

3. protected - is for when you are doing inheritance

a function inside a class is called a method


classes and object
what is a class ? is a blueprint for creating objects
what is an object? is an instance of a class

why do we need them ?
classes help organize code
debugging
reusability

data types in cpp:
1. user defined = class, structure, enum
2. built in = interger, floting point, character, boolean
3. derived = function, array, pointer

memory is usually divided into cells wihtout fixed size as it depends on what is being stored
int a = 10 --- data types determine how big the size of memory the variable will occupy

class syntax:

class ClassName{
some data
some functions
};


we have three cases
1. camel case
snake case
pascal case
